# Homework 3

1. Expand out the model of the ToDo. The ToDo should have the following properties:

Text of the To Do (string)
Due Date of the To Do (date)
Priority of the To Do (number)
Completed (bool)

Upgrade the ToDo list to be displayed as a ToDo table. Display a column for the ToDo text, due date, priority, and completed. Be sure to show column headers.

The last column of the table should have a header of "Actions". Please the delete button in the last column.

Upgrade the form, to allow the use to specify the ToDo text, due date, and the priority.

2. Add an action button which marks the ToDo as completed.

3. Filter the list to show only the ToDos which are not completed.

4. Under the table display the number of total todos, and the number of completed todos.
