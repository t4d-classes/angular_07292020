# Homework 4

1. Please create a custom pipe to display the complete/incomplete status.

2. Use the built-in date pipe to format the due date.

3. Upgrade the todo item model to use id's instead of index.

4. Click on the date header to sort by date. Click on the priority header to sort by priority. Only code it to sort ascending.

5. Cache the result of the sort (so it can be re-used). Invalidate the cache when adding a todo or removing a todo. Use the Map to implement the cache.

6. Add some kind of toggle to show/hide completed items. When shown, allow the items to be sorted by complete/incomplete.

7. Ensure it works!
