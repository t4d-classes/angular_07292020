# Sort and Pagination

1. Using the sort and slicing features of JSON Server ([sort](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#sort), [slice](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#slice)) implement column sorting and table pagination for the used car table. When you click a column header the first time, sort the table on that column in ascending order. When you click it again, sort it in descending order. Display some kind of sort order indicator in the header.

2. For the pagination part, paginate the record so that only 5 cars are shown at a time. Provide a previous and next button to navigate from page to page. Disable the previous button on the first page, and disable the next button on the last page. Display the total number of pages and the current page between the previous and next buttons.

3. Ensure it works!
