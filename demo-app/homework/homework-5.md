# Homework 5

1. Implement a filter for the item column. When a user types text into an input field, use the value of the input field to filter the todo list based upon the item using a "contains" filter. The sorting and completed toggle should work on the filtered list. And the filtered list should be cached.

2. You may run the filter as the user types into the box, or after the user types into the box and clicks a button.

3. Ensure it works!
